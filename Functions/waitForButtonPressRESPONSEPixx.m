function [ responseButton, responseTime, startTime, stopTime ] = waitForButtonPressRESPONSEPixx( whichButtons, forWhat, flipAtStart, whenToStart, lightIntensity, equipment, display )
%WAITFORBUTTONPRESSRESPONSEPIXX Wait for a button press from the
%RESPONSEPixx then returns.
%   WAITFORBUTTONPRESSRESPONSEPIXX waits for a button press from the
%   RESPONSEPixx then returns. Called without any arguments, the function 
%   assumes a five-button box and registers any depressed key, even if the
%   key was already pressed at the time of the function call.
%
%   WAITFORBUTTONPRESSRESPONSEPIXX(whichButtons) sets the buttons to
%   register. See below for the button configurations on 4- and 5-button
%   RESPONSEPixx. Defaults to accepting any button, but you can specify a
%   vector of buttons to accept (e.g. whichButtons==[1,3] would accept only
%   the right and left button on a 5-button box). In dummy mode (see below)
%   defaults to accepting any key, but you could instead specify here a
%   vector of keyCodes (see KbName).
%
%   WAITFORBUTTONPRESSRESPONSEPIXX(whichButtons, forWhat) allows you to
%   specify the event that should trigger the function to return. By
%   default, (forWhat==0), the function returns as soon as an allowed
%   button is depressed. Setting forWhat==1 will wait until an allowed
%   button is depressed and then released. Setting forWhat==2 will first
%   wait until all buttons have been released, then return when an allowed
%   button is depressed. Setting forWhat==3 will first wait until all
%   buttons have been released, then wait until an allowed button is
%   depressed and then released. This behaviour is similar to the forWhat
%   flag in KbWait, except that when forWhat==2 or 3, KbWait not only waits
%   until all keys have been released, but requires that a key is pressed 
%   (and/or released) in isolation. This is also the behaviour of this
%   function in dummy mode (see below), which uses KbWait.
%
%   WAITFORBUTTONPRESSRESPONSEPIXX(whichButtons, forWhat, flipAtStart)
%   specifies whether to start buffering immediately (default,
%   flipAtStart==0) or whether to flip the screen and start the buffer at
%   the same time (flipAtStart==1). If set to >0, a PsychToolbox window
%   must be open, and its index stored in the field display.ptbWindow (see
%   below). Note that setting to 1 will also cause buffering to continue
%   until the next flip after a valid response is received, which will
%   delay the return of the function by up to one monitor refresh. Setting
%   to flipAtStart==2 will flip the screen without clearing the
%   framebuffer. This is useful if you plan to append something to the
%   frame displayed on this flip.
%
%   WAITFORBUTTONPRESSRESPONSEPIXX(whichButtons, forWhat, flipAtStart, 
%   whenToStart) specifies a time (in GetSecs time) to start buffering. If
%   flipAtStart==0, it will start buffering at time whenToStart. If
%   flipAtStart==1, it will start buffering at the first flip after
%   whenToStart.
%
%   WAITFORBUTTONPRESSRESPONSEPIXX(whichButtons, forWhat, flipAtStart, 
%   whenToStart, lightIntensity) sets the intensity of the lights on the
%   allowed buttons. Defaults to lightIntensity==0, which preserves the
%   current state of the RESPONSEPixx. Otherwise, all allowed buttons are
%   illuminated at level lightIntensity until a valid response is received;
%   after buffering stops, all lights are turned off.
%
%   WAITFORBUTTONPRESSRESPONSEPIXX(whichButtons, forWhat, flipAtStart, 
%   whenToStart, lightIntensity, equipment) allows you to pass information
%   about the response equipment, in the following fields [with defaults in
%   parentheses]:
%   
%       equipment.nButtons [5] defines the number of buttons to query, up
%       to 16 (or up to 5 in dummy mode, although calling more in dummy
%       mode shouldn't cause issues).
%
%       equipment.dummyMode [0] indicates whether the function should run 
%       in the absence of a RESPONSEPixx box. Defaults to 0, indicating 
%       that a RESPONSEPixx is present. Set to 1 to initialise dummy mode, 
%       using the keyboard as a response device.
%
%   WAITFORBUTTONPRESSRESPONSEPIXX(whichButtons, forWhat, flipAtStart, 
%   whenToStart, lightIntensity, equipment, display) allows you to pass
%   information about the display equipment, in the following fields:
%   
%       display.ptbWindow gives the index to the PsychToolbox window. This
%       is required if flipAtStart is set to 1.
%
%   responseButton = WAITFORBUTTONPRESSRESPONSEPIXX returns the button
%   index (see tables below) of the button that caused the function to
%   return. In the case of a dead heat between buttons, it returns the one
%   with the lowest index. In dummy mode, this returns the index of the
%   button that corresponds to the key (and not the keyCode itself).
%
%   [responseButton, responseTime] = WAITFORBUTTONPRESSRESPONSEPIXX also
%   returns the time at which the event was registered. The field 'box'
%   gives the time in DATAPixx time; the field 'getSecs' gives the time in
%   GetSecs time. In dummy mode, both of these are in GetSecs time, but
%   both are returned in case the value is expected by the calling
%   function.
%
%   [responseButton, responseTime, startTime] =
%   WAITFORBUTTONPRESSRESPONSEPIXX also returns the time at which buffering
%   started. As for responseTime, DATAPixx time and GetSecs time are
%   returned in the fields 'box' and 'getSecs', respectively. Both are
%   GetSecs time in dummy mode.
%
%   [responseButton, responseTime, startTime, stopTime] =
%   WAITFORBUTTONPRESSRESPONSEPIXX also returns the time at which buffering
%   stopped. As for responseTime and starttime, DATAPixx time and GetSecs
%   time are returned in the fields 'box' and 'getSecs', respectively. Both
%   are GetSecs time in dummy mode.
